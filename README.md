# Zombie-Command-Line-script
The code I provided showcases several basic programming concepts, such as:

Object-oriented programming (OOP): The script defines two classes, Human and Zombie, which have their own attributes (name and health) and methods (take_damage() and attack()).

Encapsulation: The implementation of the classes ensures that the internal state of the objects is protected and can only be accessed or modified through their methods, this practice is known as encapsulation.

Randomness: The script uses the random library to generate random damage values for the zombie' attacks and also to select a random human for the zombies to attack.

Control flow: The script uses a while loop to simulate the game and a for loop to iterate over the zombies. It also uses if-else statements to check whether all the humans or all the zombies have been eliminated and print the appropriate message.

Function definition: The script has a function create_directory_and_move_files(directory_name) that takes in the directory name as input and creates a new directory with that name and moves all files from the current working directory into the new directory.

Error handling: The script uses try-except block to handle different types of errors that may occur while making a request.
